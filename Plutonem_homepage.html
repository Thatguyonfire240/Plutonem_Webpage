        <p>A library to draw graphics with pixels in the terminal</p>
        <h2>Who needs a GUI when you have a terminal?</h2>
        <h2>Building</h2>
            <p>To generate libpluto.a, run:
                <br>$ make
            </p>
            <p>To install it so that your compiler can use it directly, run:
                <br>$ make install
            </p>
            <p>To compile some examples, run:
                <br>$ make exp
            </p>
            <p>Pre-compiled library files are available in the releases tab (only for Linux x86-64)</p>

        <h2>Using the library</h2>
            <p>1. Include the pluto header in your source file
                <br># include [path to pluto.h] // do #include [pluto.h] if the lib is already installed
            </p>
            <p>2. Write your source code. An example program which draws a line:
                <br>#include [stdlib.h]
                <br>#include "pluto.h"									/* Change path if needed */
                <br>
                <br>int main()
                <br>{
                <br>    pluto_init_window();								/* Initialize pluto */
            </p>
